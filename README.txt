Version 2.0: OpenMP optomized version for Intel

ALADYN mini-app is a simple molecular dynamics (MD) code for performing 
constant energy atomistic simulations using artificial neural networks 
(ANN) interatomic potential trained for Al crystal structure.
The trained ANN was produced and offered by Ganga P. Pun and Yuri Mishin 
from George Mason University.

=======================================================================

 COMPILATION

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* FORTRAN compiler (Intel 2003 or newer, or PGI FORTRAN with OpenACC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Source directory: ALADYN.source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation: use the provided makefiles with the following options:

Intel compiler:
> make -f makefile.intel            ! compiles with -O3 optimization on 
> make -f makefile.intel DEBUG=TRUE ! check and warning flags on
> make -f makefile.intel OMP=TRUE   ! compile with OpenMP direectives

PGI compiler:
> make -f makefile.pgi              ! compiles with -O3 optimization on 
> make -f makefile.pgi DEBUG=TRUE   ! check and warning flags on
> make -f makefile.pgi OMP=TRUE     ! compile with OpenMP direectives
> make -f makefile.pgi ACC=TRUE  ! compile with OpenMP+OpenACC direectives

Notes: 
1. This release contains two versions of the aladyn_ANN.f file, 
aladyn_ANN_Intrinsic.f and aladyn_ANN_Extrinsic.f, which can be
used intercahgeably thorugh the makefile. The two versions differ only in 
the Frc_ANN_OMP() subroutine. In the Intrinsic version, the 
energy and force calculations are done atom by atom, while in the 
Extrinsic version they are done one operation at a time for all atoms.

Edit the provided makefiles for specific compiler option of your choice
=======================================================================

 EXECUTION

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Run from the example (test) directory: ALADYN.test

Running a tets case:
> aladyn              ! executes 10 MD steps reporting at each step
> aladyn -n 100 -m 10 ! executes 100 MD steps, reporting every 10-th step

Available PBS scripts used for NASA/LaRC K3 cluster:
ALADYN_intel.job      - run the intel version
ALADYN_pgi_V100.job   - run the pgi version with OpneACC for V100 gpu.

Screen output is riderected to aladyn.out

Example outputs are saved in: aladyn_intel.out and aladyn_pgi.out
=======================================================================
